Data mockups with generated examples are in /mockData. You are expected to make a fork from this repo to start your project. If you don't like these generated apps you can create your own and just take /mockData for your need.

## Set-Up

Navigate to the preferred directory, and hit `npm install` to pull modules. READMEs are generated for both repos you can check them for library/framework-specific instructions.
